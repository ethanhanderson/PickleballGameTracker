/// Factory for generating completed game instances with realistic data for previews and testing.
///
/// The factory provides a fluent builder-style API that defaults to generating randomized data
/// while allowing any property to be explicitly specified. This ensures preview data remains
/// realistic and varied while supporting specific testing scenarios.
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// Generate a random completed game:
/// ```swift
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory().generate()
/// ```
///
/// Generate a specific scenario:
/// ```swift
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory()
///     .gameType(.tournament)
///     .scores(winner: 15, loser: 13)
///     .timestamp(hoursAgo: 2)
///     .duration(minutes: 35)
///     .generate()
/// ```
///
/// ## Batch Generation
///
/// Generate multiple games at once:
/// ```swift
/// let games = CompletedGameFactory.batch(count: 10)
/// ```
///
/// Generate games with specific constraints:
/// ```swift
/// let recentGames = CompletedGameFactory.batch(count: 5) { factory in
///     factory
///         .gameType(.recreational)
///         .timestamp(withinDays: 3)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Realistic Data
///
/// The factory generates data that reflects real-world pickleball:
/// - Scores respect winning score rules and win-by-two requirements
/// - Duration correlates with score differential and rally count
/// - Rally counts are proportional to total points scored
/// - Timestamps can be distributed across hours, days, or weeks
///
/// ## Integration with Roster
///
/// When a ModelContext is provided, the factory can assign games to real players/teams:
/// ```swift
/// // Auto-assign random players for singles
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory(context: modelContext)
///     .withPlayers()
///     .generate()
///
/// // Auto-assign random teams for doubles
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory(context: modelContext)
///     .withTeams()
///     .generate()
/// ```
///
/// Or assign specific entities:
/// ```swift
/// // Assign specific players
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory(context: modelContext)
///     .assignPlayers(player1, player2)
///     .generate()
///
/// // Assign specific teams
/// let game = CompletedGameFactory(context: modelContext)
///     .assignTeams(team1, team2)
///     .generate()
/// ```
