# Pickleball Score Tracking — Kanban Roadmap

- Purpose: A single source of truth for feature development planning that links to authoritative docs, keeps work organized by app version, and guides LLM agents to ship safely.
- Scope: Features and cross-cutting systems for iOS, watchOS, and `SharedGameCore`.
- Editing rule: This file is the only planning board. Keep details in `docs/architecture/*`, `docs/features/*`, and `docs/systems/*` and link to them from cards.
- Last updated: 2025-08-17

## How to use this board

1. Pick the correct version lane (v0.3, v0.6, v1.0).
2. Ensure the card meets the Definition of Ready (see `docs/systems/devx/roadmap-governance.md#definition-of-ready-dor`).
3. Move only the card(s) you are actively working on to In Progress (respect WIP limits).
4. Update the card’s Status, Notes, and Acceptance as you progress. Keep cards small (S/M/L/XL).
5. All implementation details live in linked docs/code. If scope changes, update the linked docs first, then reflect the card here.
6. When a card hits Done, ensure acceptance is met and all links are correct. Add a brief completion note.

## Board columns and rules

- Backlog: Approved work, ready to pick up next.
- In Progress (WIP ≤ 3 across all lanes): Actively developed. Keep scope tight.
- Blocked: Waiting on dependency or decision. Must list a clear unblocking step.
- In Review: Code and docs updated; validating builds/tests and UX.
- Done: Accepted against the version’s criteria; all cross-links valid.
- Parked: Deferred. Keep rationale and re-evaluate date.

Definition of Done (all must be true)

- Linked docs updated and lint-clean; acceptance checklist satisfied in the linked doc(s)
- iOS/watchOS build green with Swift 6.2 strict concurrency and no critical warnings
- Tests updated/passing where applicable
- Logging via `LoggingService` (no `print`)

```

Tag taxonomy

- tags: [ui, storage, sync, logging, testing, navigation, analytics, auth, players, teams, variations, statistics, history, active-game, watch]

Conventions

- IDs match version lanes: 1.x = v0.3, 2.x = v0.6, 3.x = v1.0
- Prefer one observable outcome per card. Split large efforts into sequential cards.
- Keep acceptance minimal but testable; point to authoritative checklists in linked docs.
- See `docs/systems/devx/chat-kickoff.md` for a step-by-step new-chat guide and `docs/systems/devx/build-and-ci.md` for deterministic commands.

acceptance:
  - Views adhere to feature-first structure; unnecessary micro-components removed; worthy components extracted per sizing guidance
  - Shared elements live under `UI/Components/` only when reused across features; otherwise remain feature-scoped
  - iOS and watchOS builds succeed on pinned destinations with no new warnings
validation:

tests:

notes:
  - Perform a pass across iOS and watchOS targets: collapse trivial headers (1–3 elements) back inline; extract complex cards (5+ elements and nested groups) to `Components/`. Ensure `DesignSystem` tokens are used throughout.
  - Completed: Promoted `GameOptionCard` to `UI/Components/GameOptionCard.swift`; removed feature-local duplicate; references remain valid. iOS build triggered; observed unrelated `SharedGameCore` protocol conformance error to be fixed separately.
  - Completed: Acceptance verified — iOS and watchOS builds/tests green on pinned simulators (watch UI test bundle skipped). Scans performed; consolidations applied where warranted; no over-generalization of feature-scoped components.

## Agent workflow quickstart

- Start here: Find a Backlog card in your version lane, confirm dependencies, and move it to In Progress.
- Update docs first: If behavior or architecture changes, update `docs/*` before code; then commit code and return here.
- Keep one focus: Stay under WIP limits. Prefer completing a card before starting another.
- Close the loop: When done, ensure builds/tests are green and acceptance criteria are met. Move card to Done and add a one-line completion note.

Automatic selection (when you say "start a new task")

- Lane: Uses the active version lane in focus (default v0.3) unless specified.
- Rule: Picks Backlog cards with all dependencies Done, ordered by priority (P0→P1→P2), then size (S→M→L→XL), then fewest dependencies, then lowest ID.
- WIP: If WIP is at limit, will propose finishing/parking an In Progress card first.
