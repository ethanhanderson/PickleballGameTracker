# Agent Development Rules

When writing new code, only write comments that add crutial context to a complex block of code. Never write comments describing what a block of code does when the purpose of the code can be understood by reading the code. When editing a file, take time to clean up these kinds of comments from it.

Never create additional MD files as part of your response, simply respond with your findings or conclusions.
