# Git Versioning & Branch Strategy

This project ships in three lanes (v0.3, v0.6, v1.0) as documented in [docs/implementation-roadmap.md](mdc:docs/implementation-roadmap.md). Use trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches mapped to roadmap cards, release branches at freeze, and semantic tags.

## Branches
- main: always stable, shippable; current lane focus (default v0.3). PRs merge here.
- release/vX.Y: cut when freezing a version (e.g., `release/v0.3`); accept only hotfixes/backports; tag from here.
- feature/<card-id>-<slug>: short-lived per roadmap card. Examples:
  - feature/1.22-team-creation (v0.3)
  - feature/2.2-supabase-client (v0.6)
  - feature/3.1-realtime-sync (v1.0)
- epic/<card-id>-<slug>: optional, time-boxed integration branch for multi-PR efforts; rebase often; close when merged.
- hotfix/vX.Y.Z: emergency fixes from release branches; back-merge or cherry-pick to main after tagging.

## Tags
- Semantic version tags: v0.3.0, v0.3.1, v0.6.0-alpha.1, etc.

## PR Hygiene
- Reference the roadmap card in the PR title/description (e.g., "1.22: Team creation").
- Update and link docs under `docs/*` per the card’s Validation checklist before merge.
- Label PRs with the lane: v0.3, v0.6, or v1.0.
- Require green builds on pinned destinations (see [docs/systems/devx/build-and-ci.md](mdc:docs/systems/devx/build-and-ci.md)).

## Commands (copy/paste)
- Start a feature (example: 1.22 Team creation):
```bash
git switch -c feature/1.22-team-creation
```
- Cut a release and tag:
```bash
git switch main && git pull
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "v0.3.0" && git push origin v0.3.0
git switch -c release/v0.3 && git push -u origin release/v0.3
```
- Hotfix and back-merge:
```bash
git switch -c hotfix/v0.3.1 release/v0.3
# commit fix, open PR to release/v0.3, then after merge:
git tag -a v0.3.1 -m "v0.3.1" && git push origin v0.3.1
# back-merge to main (or cherry-pick) to keep histories aligned
```

## Mapping roadmap to branches
- v0.3 cards use `1.x` IDs → `feature/1.xx-<slug>`
- v0.6 cards use `2.x` IDs → `feature/2.xx-<slug>`
- v1.0 cards use `3.x` IDs → `feature/3.xx-<slug>`

## Active development now
- Based on the roadmap, 1.22 (Team creation) is In Progress → branch: `feature/1.22-team-creation`.
- Ensure docs under `docs/features/player-team-management.md` stay updated during PRs.
