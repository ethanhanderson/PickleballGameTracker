# Feature Maintenance & Architecture Optimization

## Overview

This document outlines systematic maintenance tasks for feature components and views, ensuring they align with project architecture patterns, follow SwiftUI best practices, and maintain optimal organization. These tasks focus on semantic naming, code deduplication, architectural compliance, and reusability while respecting the project's view architecture guidelines.

## Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Component Semantic Analysis & Naming Convention Alignment

**Objective**: Ensure all UI components follow consistent semantic naming that reflects their visual role and design system categorization.

**Process**:

- **Analyze Component Purpose**: Determine the primary visual and functional role of each component
- **Apply Design System Naming**: Rename components to use appropriate design system terminology:
  - `Card` - Information containers with glass effects and borders (e.g., `GameTypeCard`, `RuleInfoCard`)
  - `Bezel` - Structural containers without decorative effects (e.g., `SectionBezel`)
  - `Chip` - Small interactive elements (e.g., `StatusChip`, `FilterChip`)
  - `Row` - List item components (e.g., `PlayerRow`, `GameRow`)
  - `Section` - Layout grouping components (e.g., `StatsSection`, `GameSection`)

**Examples**:

- `RuleInfoCard` → `RuleCard` (more concise, maintains semantic meaning)
- `SectionContainer` → `SectionBezel` (better reflects design system role)
- `MetricColumn` → `MetricCard` (if it has card-like styling)

**Validation Criteria**:

- Component name clearly indicates its visual role
- Follows established naming patterns in the codebase
- Aligns with Design System documentation
- Maintains backward compatibility where needed

### 2. Component Lifecycle Audit & Cleanup

**Objective**: Identify and properly manage unused, stale, or misplaced components to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

**Process**:

- **Usage Analysis**: Search codebase for component references and usage patterns
- **Relevance Assessment**: Evaluate if components serve current feature requirements
- **Architectural Fit**: Determine if components belong in their current location or should be moved

**Categories to Identify**:

#### Unused Components (Safe to Remove)

- Components with no references in the codebase
- Components replaced by newer implementations
- Components from removed features

#### Stale Components (Require Review)

- Components with minimal usage (1-2 places)
- Components that could be replaced by DesignSystem primitives
- Components with outdated styling or patterns

#### Misplaced Components (Require Relocation)

- Feature-specific components in shared UI location
- Utility components in feature-specific locations
- Components that should be promoted to shared status

**Action Protocol**:

- **Immediate Removal**: Delete unused components after confirmation
- **Deprecation Path**: Mark stale components for future removal with deprecation warnings
- **Relocation**: Move misplaced components to appropriate architectural locations
- **Documentation**: Update component documentation to reflect status

### 3. Architectural Code Placement Optimization

**Objective**: Ensure computed properties, helper functions, and utility code reside in the most appropriate architectural layer according to project patterns.

**Process**:

- **Analyze Current Placement**: Review where computed properties and helpers are defined
- **Identify Optimal Location**: Determine if code should be moved to:
  - **Models/Services**: Domain logic, complex calculations, data transformations
  - **ViewModels**: UI state orchestration, user interaction handling
  - **Core Package**: Shared business logic, reusable utilities
  - **Extensions**: Protocol extensions, computed properties on existing types

**Code Categories to Evaluate**:

#### Model/Service Candidates

- Complex data transformations and calculations
- Business logic that doesn't depend on UI context
- Reusable algorithms and data processing
- Validation and error handling logic

#### ViewModel Candidates

- UI state management and orchestration
- User interaction handling and flow control
- Data formatting for display purposes
- Temporary state that coordinates multiple views

#### Core Package Candidates

- Shared utilities used across multiple features
- Common algorithms and data structures
- Protocol definitions and shared behaviors
- Cross-cutting concerns like logging, analytics

**Placement Decision Framework**:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: What does the code depend on?
2. **Usage Scope**: Where is the code used (single feature vs. multiple features)?
3. **Architectural Layer**: Which layer best fits the code's purpose?
4. **Testability**: Where can the code be most effectively tested?

### 4. Utility Code Refactoring & SwiftUI Pattern Compliance

**Objective**: Refactor utility code to be reusable, maintainable, and compliant with project SwiftUI patterns and modern Swift practices.

**Process**:

- **Identify Utility Code**: Find computed variables, helper functions, and utility methods
- **Analyze Reusability**: Determine if code is used once or multiple times
- **Apply SwiftUI Patterns**: Ensure code follows project conventions:
  - Proper @MainActor usage for UI-related code
  - Structured concurrency with async/await
  - @Observable patterns for state management
  - DesignSystem token usage
  - Accessibility compliance

**Refactoring Categories**:

#### Single-Use Utilities (Inline or Extract)

- Computed properties specific to one view
- Helper functions used only in one context
- View-specific formatting and styling logic

#### Multi-Use Utilities (Extract to Shared)

- Common formatting functions (dates, numbers, strings)
- Shared styling patterns and layout helpers
- Repeated calculation or transformation logic

#### Pattern Compliance Updates

- Replace imperative code with declarative SwiftUI patterns
- Update to modern Swift 6 concurrency patterns
- Ensure proper actor isolation for UI updates
- Apply @Observable for complex state management

**SwiftUI Compliance Checklist**:

- [ ] Uses @MainActor for UI-related async work
- [ ] Applies structured concurrency (Task { @MainActor in })
- [ ] Follows DesignSystem token usage
- [ ] Implements proper accessibility features
- [ ] Uses modern SwiftUI modifiers and APIs
- [ ] Maintains preview stability with test data

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Systematic Execution

- **Order of Operations**: Follow tasks in sequence to maintain architectural integrity
- **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes to minimize risk
- **Testing Integration**: Run tests after each significant change
- **Documentation Updates**: Update component documentation to reflect changes

### 2. Quality Assurance

- **Architecture Review**: Ensure changes align with view architecture guidelines
- **Design System Compliance**: Verify all styling uses DesignSystem tokens
- **Accessibility Testing**: Test components with VoiceOver and accessibility tools
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure changes don't impact performance

### 3. Documentation Requirements

- **Component Documentation**: Keep docstrings current with usage examples
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document why components were moved or renamed
- **Deprecation Notices**: Add deprecation warnings for components scheduled for removal
- **Usage Guidelines**: Update any usage documentation or examples

## Validation Criteria

### Component Naming
